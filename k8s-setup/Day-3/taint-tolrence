### Taint
A taint is a property that you can apply to nodes to repel pods from being scheduled on them.
It consists of three parts: key, value, and effect.
It tells kubernetes:
 Do not schedule pods on this node unless they have a matching toleration.

There are three effects:
- NoSchedule: Do not schedule new pods
- PreferNoSchedule: Try not to schedule new pods
- NoExecute: Do not schedule new pods and evict existing pods
  
You add a taint to a node using kubectl taint. For example,

```
kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
```
Check if the taint was applied:

```
kubectl describe nodes node1 | grep Taint
```



To remove the taint:

```
kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule-
```

### Toleration
Toleration is a property that you can apply to pods to allow them to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints.
It has three main components: key, value, and effect, which must match the taint to be tolerated.
For example, to tolerate the taint above:

```
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

This toleration allows pods to be scheduled on nodes with the taint `key1=value1:NoSchedule`.
