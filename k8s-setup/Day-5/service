Service is an abstraction or method in k8s that helps you expose group of pods over a network. 
They provide a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of pods, allowing them to be accessed by other pods or external clients without needing to know their individual IP addresses.

Types of Services:
- ClusterIP: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP
- NodePort: Exposes the service on each Node's IP at a static port
- LoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer
- ExternalName: Maps the service to a DNS name
- Headless: Creates a service without a cluster IP, like we have to define clusterIP none, useful for stateful applications
- ExternalDNS: Exposes the service using an external DNS name

Headless service:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: postgres
  labels:
    app: postgres
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 5432
    name: postgres
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: postgres
