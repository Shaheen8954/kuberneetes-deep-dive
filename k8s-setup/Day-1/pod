### What is a Pod in Kubernetes? 

A Pod is the smallest and simplest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
pod contains one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage volumes.
Kubernetes does not run containers directly.
It always runs containers inside a Pod.
Pods are the basic building blocks of Kubernetes applications.

#### Why do we need a Pod? 
Containers alone are not enough because Kubernetes needs a wrapper to manage them.

#### Kubernetes doesn’t manage containers, it manages Pods.

#### What runs inside a Pod?

A Pod can have:
- One container, multicontainers
Example:
- Main app container, initcontainer, sidecar container
All containers in a Pod always run together on the same node.

#### Pod Networking (Very Important Concept)
Each Pod gets one unique IP address. All containers inside the Pod:
- Share the same IP
- Communicate using localhost
Example:
Container A → http://localhost:8080
Container B → http://localhost:8081

#### Pod Storage (Volumes)
Pods can use Volumes

Volumes allow containers to:
- Share data
- Persist data during container restarts

#### Important:

If a Pod is deleted → data is lost
(unless using Persistent Volumes)

Pods are Ephemeral
Pods are not permanent

#### If a Pod crashes:
Kubernetes creates a new Pod
New Pod gets a new IP

#### Interview-ready one-liner 
Pod-to-Pod communication in Kubernetes works through a flat network where each Pod gets a unique IP, and CNI plugins route traffic between Pods. Since Pod IPs are ephemeral, communication is usually done via Services, which provide stable networking and load balancing.
